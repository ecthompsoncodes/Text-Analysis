       " 'im a tv journalist who came back to france after years abroad in a southern region there has been a new channel opening up with a big international potential i met with all big staff and they loved my international background my production and on air skills they talked about having me hosting or co hosting a morning show and ended up as a columnist once a week next to the guys hosts friends of the producer she hirednow the nightmare is startingi go see the producer who tells me all themes are already taken and after several back and forth we agree on one that fits me i could sense since the e st encounter that he felt forced to place me as the channel director asked but that he didnt care at all and weirdly was blocking me so i do my st appearance on the morning set so instead of being h on the set next to the hosts my segment is now  the camera guyeditor quit after segments as they were not paying him enough i ask for a meeting about the next steps they also had to validate all my themes in advance i was proposing for future shoots they denied all the subjects i worked for telling me they are trying to have this guest or this personality on the set so me filming them at their place is a conflict which doesnt make any sense and reduce tremendously the possibility of experience in the city im supposed to shootwait for it they gave me a girl cameraeditor who works full time for them on their shows and as she heard the new task with me already frowned saying its too much for her agenda so i do one shoot with her in a cool automobile collector garage and she arrived already complaining about the size of garage the rain the guy i interviewed which she didnt like just almost harassing me with bad vibes when i was finding solutions on the spot to everything to finish the segment and still have good content she leaves the set by telling me ok everything was good we just need to make it a bit shorter next time not more then h on the spot as the producer dont want me to spend more time on your segment i agreed to anything she said to play along i then receive a mail listing all she didnt like about the shoot and this and this im only a freelance for this production so i cannot push the conflict as its cristal clear the production will take her side i still answered a bitter mail stating all the real facts and saying that it is very counter productive etc i go in the edit room to help her on the editing and to show that im willing to help and as soon as i arrive she says that there is wayyyy too much clips from my previous shoot with the other guy that shes editing that it took her sooooooo much time that she doesnt think she can work with me thats its a personality matter etc i was in schock if i go to the fight with her or if she tells the team she cant work with me they will get rid of me as i could already sense the producer and the hosts are forcing themselves with me being weird and silent and not caring at alli tried to be super nice and we finished the edit in h at she confirms to me the coming dates she has open in november to shoot i thought i saved the situation telling her no problem in the next time we will do less clips and will stick to h etcfinale i just received a mail from her saying she wants to finish the edits of my segments before telling me what dates in november she is willing to shoot which puts me to failure and in the risk of shooting only one segment instead of in november and loosing my subjects as it takes at least weeks to organize the shoots and block also my agenda on these dates she cc the hosts producer and i answered that i cant work this way and we need a solution to give me reliable dates in advance now i feel sick to my stomach as she clearly wants me to fail shes a fucking nobody not even experienced in tv but old time friend of the producer so here are my last optionscalling the host or producer to explain this and ask them how to work this way knowing that chances out of they would be happy to jump on this to tell me its too complicated we dont have any solution so id be stuck with just one shoot during the month when and if she wantstoday walking into the production company reaching the editing room the co host was there and you could sense there is a thick invisible awkwardness silence he didnt even ask me how everything is going etc nada after not seing the team for weeks as i shoot remotely instead of on the set with them last option i have a meeting coming with the channel director and the problem is that she told me in the past that she likes a lot this producer she said you ll see you ll meet him his fantastic by the way this producer has no experience in tv he used to have free luxury magazines and a local radio so my goal was to dennounced how they are treating me and ask her if there are other shows or productions she can buy from me but the danger is that she will think im the problem in this team and probably wont be willing to change anything among this production nor buying me smg its so unfair i dont know what to do this money for these segments are important right now thats why i feel also vulnerable it was my feet back into tv after years of break another columnist told me she was schocked how they all try to makes me quitstop and block me in every corner she believes the guys are jealous and fearful i take too much placei have rage and anger its the only entertaining show on this channel so there is not much options to put me anywhere else what would you do  many many many thx',\n",
