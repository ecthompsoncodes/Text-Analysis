7,17p0ste,fromorphantohighflye,2023-11-06 11:39:03+00:00,Advice for a pitching a WW2 story,"Hello everyone,  
 

I am seeking the collective advice of this subreddit. 

I was the bestfriend and carer of a WW2 RAF bomber pilot. I knew him for 16 years and was his carer for 3 (he had no family, though the mystery surronding his biological family was solved in 2021). 

After he almost died in 2018, I managed to convince him to let me help him record his incredible life story. He was an orphan who was beaten by his first foster father, had little self-confidence or self-esteem during his childhood, yet had his life changed during WW2. He travelled through Africa, the Middle East and the Far East with the RAF before captaining B-24 Liberators with 159 Squadron against Japanese forces in Burma, Malaya and Thailand at the age of 20. 

In total, he had an almost 15-year RAF career. His life story is incredible, and he changed my life completely. He was the greatest man I have ever met. 

Our book has gone on to sell very well, both in Britain and abroad. 

Now, I wish to pitch this story to relevant media outlets here in the UK. Denis's life story, and our friendship, have resonated with thousands around the world. Does anyone have any advice on how to pitch our story, what to focus on, how to make the approach, anything to keep in mind, dos and don'ts? (Note, we have already received coverage in the *Daily Express* and some regional newspapers. I don't know if that would help or hinder?) 

I have attached a photo of me and Denis and a link for our website if they are of any help: [www.fromorphantohighflyer.com](https://www.fromorphantohighflyer.com)

&#x200B;

Thank you,

&#x200B;

And if I ever need something that I can't do myself, I'm usually pretty good at working with freelancers online to 'get things done'.

42,17lr155,chrisouille,2023-11-02 00:36:39+00:00,"TV journalist being bullied and overshadowed/ dilemma among the production company and a new channel, HELP !","Im a TV journalist who came back to France after years abroad. In a southern region there has been a new channel opening up with a big international potential. I met with all big staff and they loved my international background my production and on air skills. They talked about having me hosting or co hosting a morning show, and ended up as a columnist once a week next to the 2 guys hosts friends of the producer she hired.
Now the nightmare is starting:
I go see the producer who tells me all themes are already taken (I suggested a lot of different specialty) and after several back and forth we agree on one that fits me. I could sense since the e 1st encounter that he felt forced to place me as the channel director asked but that he didn‚Äôt CARE at all and weirdly was ‚Äúblocking‚Äù me. 
So I do my 1st appearance on the morning set (I have 15 years experience of TV) and at the end the producer tells me he realizes ‚ÄúMy charisma, my experience and personality is standing out so instead of being among all the other columnists around the table on the set‚Äù he suggests I have my own segment outside with a cameraman, showing the viewer a great experience (Hotels spas arts exhibit etc.)
So Instead of being 1h on the set next to the hosts, my segment is now 3‚Äô30 (Per week!!!) 
The camera guy/editor quit after 3 segments as they were not paying him enough. 

I ask for a meeting about the next steps, they also had to validate all my 5-6 themes in advance I was proposing for future shoots. 
They denied all the subjects i worked for telling me ‚ÄúThey are trying to have this guest or this personality on the set so me filming them at their place is a conflict‚Äù. Which doesn‚Äôt make any sense and reduce tremendously the possibility of ‚Äúexperience in the city‚Äù i‚Äôm supposed to shoot.

Wait for it‚Ä¶.. They gave me a girl camera/editor who works full time for them on their shows and as she heard the new task with me, ALREADY frowned saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs too much for her agenda‚Äù. 

So I do ONE shoot with her, in a cool automobile collector garage, and she arrived already complaining about the size of garage, the rain, the guy i interviewed which she didn‚Äôt like, just almost harassing me with bad vibes when I was finding solutions on the spot to everything to finish the segment and still have good content. 
She leaves the set by telling me ‚ÄúOk everything was good we just need to make it a bit shorter next time not more then 1h30 on the spot as the producer don‚Äôt want me to spend more time on your segment‚Äù. I agreed to anything she said ‚Äúto play along‚Äù.  I then receive a mail listing all she didn‚Äôt like about the shoot (First time in 15 years i receive a mail from a camera/editor being so offensive so personnaly attacking almost a conspiracy to have me QUIT). She mentions she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable during the shoot, she didn‚Äôt like the guy i chose to interview, we took too long ( She stays 15 min in the garage to ask for a dedicated book for her son‚Ä¶..), and this and this‚Ä¶. 
Im only a FREELANCE for this production (Which was sooooo not planned after all the many talks for months with the channel) so I cannot push the conflict as it‚Äôs cristal clear the production will take her side. I still answered a bitter mail stating all the real facts and saying that it is very counter productive etc. 

I go in the edit ROOM to HELP her on the editing and to show that i‚Äôm willing to help and as soon as I arrive she says that ‚ÄúThere is wayyyy too much clips from my previous shoot with the other guy, that she‚Äôs editing, that it took her sooooooo much time that she doesn‚Äôt think she can work with me, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a personality matter etc. 
I was IN SCHOCK. If i go to the fight with her or if she tells the team she can‚Äôt work with me they WILL get rid of me as I could already sense the producer and the 2 hosts are forcing themselves with me, being weird and silent and not caring at all.
I tried to be super nice and we finished the edit in 2h at 90%. She confirms to me the 4 COMING DATES she has open in november to shoot. 
I thought I ‚Äúsaved‚Äù the situation, telling her ‚Äúno problem in the next time we will do less clips and will stick to 1h30 etc.‚Äù

FINALE: I just received a mail from her saying ‚ÄúShe wants to finish the 2 edits of my segments before telling me what dates in november she is willing to shoot‚Äù WHICH PUTS ME TO FAILURE and in the risk of shooting ONLY one segment instead of 3-4 in november and loosing my subjects as it takes at least 2 weeks to organize the shoots and block also my agenda on these dates. She Cc the 2 hosts + producer, and I answered that I CANT WORK THIS WAY and we need a solution to give me reliable dates in advance. 

Now i feel sick to my stomach as she clearly wants me to fail she‚Äôs a fucking nobody not even experienced in TV (Ex photographer) BUT old time friend of the producer. 

So here are my last options:
Calling the host or producer to explain this and ask them how to work this way ? Knowing that 2 chances out of 3 they would be happy to jump on this to tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs too complicated we don‚Äôt have any solution‚Äù so I‚Äôd be stuck with just ONE shoot during the month when and If she wants..
Today walking into the production company reaching the editing room, the co host was there and you could sense there is a THICK invisible awkwardness‚Ä¶. silence.. he didn‚Äôt even ask me how everything is going etc NADA. after not seing the team for weeks as I shoot remotely instead of on the set with them. 

Last option: I have a meeting coming with the channel director and the problem is that she told me in the past that she LIKES A LOT this producer. She said ‚ÄúYou ll see you ll meet him his fantastic !!!‚Äù BY THE WAY this ‚Äúproducer‚Äù has NO experience in TV he used to have free luxury magazines and a local radio. So my goal was to DENNOUNCED how they are treating me AND ask her if there are other shows or productions she can buy from me. But the danger is that she will think IM THE PROBLEM in this team and probably won‚Äôt be willing to change anything among this production nor buying me smg. 

It‚Äôs so unfair i don‚Äôt know what to do. 
This money for these 2-4 segments are important right now that‚Äôs why i feel also vulnerable. It was my feet back into TV after years of break. 

Another columnist told me she was schocked how they all try to makes me quit/stop and block me in every corner (Dates , themes, the girl not willing to team work‚Ä¶the awkward silences‚Ä¶) as according to her I was the best of all other columnists (No one they hired is a journalist, they are old friends they know from this region that they brought along). She believes the 2 guys are jealous and fearful I take too much place..

I have rage and anger. It‚Äôs the only ENTERTAINING show on this channel so There is not much options to put me anywhere else (Even if the director was willing to)

I am looking for self-help or some other sort of reading to help me process covering a mass shooting. 

I‚Äôm from up in Maine, and previous to the past week, worked mostly as a copy editor and visuals editor (photos, YouTube videos, graphic packages for our website). I‚Äôve covered tragedies before in the nearly 3 years working in journalism since graduating/ being hired in 2021. Maine unfortunately has a track record of child abuse and domestic violence escalations, and we recently had a shooting in April. Many people were affected by the shooting, but our team covered it much differently than the Oct. 25 mass shooting, as the circumstances were quite different. 

I‚Äôm struggling. I have periods where I‚Äôm fine; where I can appreciate my friends and family and my coworkers who have all helped to support each other through this tough time. And then I wake up from nightmares where the overline on our site reads ‚Äú(shooter name) found dead, killer still at large‚Äù or similar situations. 

I know there are many, many other people in the journalism community who‚Äôve been affected by mass shootings, and I know most journalists are good folks who can help each other out in these hard times. 

Thank you.

Edit: All of the folks who‚Äôve replied to this thread have been extremely kind. I am working on meeting with a trauma-focused therapist this weekend.

And almost always there are references to facts in our reporting, reporting which they have not done, but they never give any credit or a reference back to our reporting for. They often report this information with no attribution, just as if it‚Äôs established fact, which has led me to believe they‚Äôre lifting our reporting. I‚Äôve even noticed information reported by these outlets in these stories that had to be obtained from a public meeting, which none of these outlet‚Äôs reporters ever attend, and the meetings in many of these towns are not live-streamed, or the info came from a source, which it is never attributed to. An example is a town approved a rezoning for a popular restaurant in a Monday meeting, we pushed out the story on Tuesday morning. The town does not livestream their meetings and this outlet‚Äôs reporter was not at the meeting. By Tuesday afternoon, that pub had a story out that just was a rewording of ours containing information we obtained during the meeting and from town officials after the meeting with no attribution indicating that their reporter had not spoken with town officials after the fact and no credit given to us. Town meetings are just one example. Just this week a paper ran a carbon copy of a story we did LAST YEAR on a local endangered species with no new info reported. It‚Äôs like the reporter scrolled our site until they found something far enough back that people wouldn‚Äôt remember. Another one popped up today, a shoddy redo of a story I spent over a YEAR covering, including hundreds of hours of meetings, interviews and reporting. They posted it online and in the Sunday paper today and people are acting like this is the first they‚Äôve heard of it, despite my paper having a multitude of stories on the topic, including a detailed story on the project‚Äôs final approval last month. They post these stories online or run them in their paper and folks then act like they‚Äôre the ones breaking those stories, when they‚Äôre just lifting our stories!

Despite being the county paper, our online presence is weak (publishing co. buried our website within another of their paper‚Äôs website) and I feel like other outlets are taking advantage of that. I‚Äôm incredibly frustrated by this but know there‚Äôs nothing I can do, as these publications editors are likely encouraging this practice, because I‚Äôve dealt with this in the past. Just not as regularly as I am now. 

I‚Äôm just wondering, is this a normal practice? Because it‚Äôs not for me. Anytime I reference another outlets reporting, credit and a link to the original story is always given. It just seems so lazy to me and is beginning to kind of be a problem because I feel it‚Äôs hurting our credibility.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/17kcy54/other_outlets_stealingredoing_my_papers_reporting/,31,14,0.95,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c113160>

Recently, I‚Äôve found myself dreading going to meetings and even interacting with some of the other staff. Many of them are great people, but I find quite a few to be toxic asses and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just being sensitive

First, our EIC made this thing for a month called a ‚Äúshit list‚Äù where he‚Äôd write down the names of anyone who he thought was doing a bad job. It was displayed in the middle of the newsroom.

Also, one of our online media managers writes the captions for our social media posts. Not sure why she even does that ‚Äî I think that‚Äôs something a photographer or accompanying reporter should be doing that but that‚Äôs besides the point. Despite knowing my (very intense) course schedule, she will send me things to edit and will keep pinging me every 20 minutes until I get back to her, which is usually within 12 hours. In the meantime she throws a hissy fit telling everyone that I‚Äôm not doing my job and writing my name (and everyone else) on the board in the newsroom for not ‚Äúdoing anything.‚Äù

And finally, we also publish magazines monthly. I‚Äôll be honest and say that the quality of our writers is pretty terrible. There is a complete lack of knowledge regarding basic English conventions, journalistic structure, etc. 

Moreover, our section and managing editors literally don‚Äôt do anything. I pretty much solo-edited our 30+ page issue, fixed an absurd number of mistakes (we‚Äôre talking paragraphs that were repeated, cut off, interviewee names that were spelled wrong, etc.) chased down our inactive writers to tell them what they did wrong, how to improve, etc.

Of course, there‚Äôs one mistake that I did miss ‚Äî one of our other editor‚Äôs name was spelled wrong in the table of contents. I apologized because I did feel sloppy for missing it, but now that dude won‚Äôt stop giving me shit. He‚Äôs always telling me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúsitting on my ass‚Äù and that he needs a scapegoat to blame for all our problems, etc. 

It pisses me off because I wrote 3 pretty high-quality articles (our best ones) last month for maybe $20 each, and if it weren‚Äôt for me our work would‚Äôve essentially been unreadable from a professional standpoint. Yet I feel like everyone‚Äôs always on my ass specifically ‚Äî and not on the actual people who don‚Äôt do anything ‚Äî for being lazy.

I can‚Äôt really talk to my higher-ups about it either: our advisor seems to dislike anyone who isn‚Äôt an actual journalism student and our EIC is, well, kind of similar. I‚Äôm sure there are things I can improve, but it‚Äôs just hard to stay motivated in an environment where I feel like I‚Äôm shat on for everything I do.

95,17ibbib,AntiqueShoulder5387,2023-10-28 10:57:33+00:00,News aggregators for news / local news,"Hi Redditors!

I'm a freelance journalist providing news to various German publishers. I'm about to start my own local paper (online). It's a smaller town of around 50.000 people, and the purpose is to deliver hyper local news for our community.

  
As a start it's purely as a hobby because I love writing and I love meeting new people.

My plan is the following:

  
A) I'll update the website everyday. It will provide stories with local business people, talk with the local bakery and in general interview interesting people in my city. The interviews and stories will not be 2000 words long, but more likely 600-1000. So it should be possible to bring at least 1-2 interviews a day.

B) I'll mix it up with shorter articles. Daily weather update in our city, results of local sport teams and maybe 1-2 quote stories (I don't know if that's what it's called in English) but stories based of other medias (With interest to out city). Not copy paste, but like if New York Post cities a story from BBC and links to the OG source. Hopefully the site will have 5-7 pieces daily.

C) Eventuelly the site could get reader's letters and more. The stories would primarily be good 'news' non clickbait, to add some kind of value to our community.

I know that there is a huge chance, that the site will just 'die' one day, since the audience is very small and local and it's all depended on my time and motivation. But i feel very motivated right now and i'd like to give it a shot and see what it could lead to. At the minimum it will give me some more knowledge and let me interact with more people.

**And now the question**

To make it as succesfull as possible i need the readers to know that it's there. I'm already planning to do some local marketing. Posters at the local shops, mouth to mouth and stuff, but i'd like to do it digitally aswell.  


This is why i'm looking for news aggregators where i could sign up my website, and hopefully they'll show my content to some local people.  


Do you guys know some great apps, aggregators and others that i should reach out to when the site is live and running?  


I know and heard of these below, but i don't know which is avaliable in my area and how to apply.

1. MSN (They are in my country, and i see local newspapers (Not my city yet) i don't see any way to contact them. Can you apply, or do they just 'discover' you?
2. Google News - They are in my country, and i know i can apply in Google Publisher, but former papers i've worked with did get their content shown in Google News even though they were accepted?

Best explanation: the credit squeeze, along of course with their bankrupcy, has severely limited the budget for their stories, or, more accurately unique, (though not unique as it once was), journalism like that isn't an effective business strategy, (might be expensive to get a whole production team in a localized fucking Armageddon).

97,17i4f0i,SwimGood22,2023-10-28 02:52:25+00:00,Help! Need insight and information to how a journalist would work on a piece about murders?,"Hi all! I'm a writer, currently working on a story about a journalist (early 30s) working on a piece about a string of deaths linked to a social media forum. The story takes place in NY and the journalist ideally works somewhere like The New York Times. I have a few questions on process and procedures since I'm not familiar with this world:

&#x200B;

* My understanding is that the journalist would have an Editor? Similar to Clark Kent working at the Daily Bugle and PERRY being his Editor?
* Would a journalist who works at an established paper be allowed to pursue a story about real deaths on their own? In the story the journalist believes there's a linked cause, possibly a serial killer, rather than the deaths being random. 
* How long would a journalist have to work on a piece like this? And what is the process of investigating/writing > publish.
* If the journalist needs an extension, how would that work with their Editor?
* In my story, the journalist takes it on their own to go ""off the record"" and beaten path, almost becoming a detective as they try to piece the story together. Going to interviews at the subject's house, etc. Has this happened before?
* Does a journalist use a pen and paper during an interview, or record on a tape? Or do they use their iPhones/smartphones during an interview?",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/17i4f0i/help_need_insight_and_information_to_how_a/,6,2,0.75,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c1d6d30>

This was originally posted in the PR Reddit Thread but a lot of my content writing/internal articles is more reliant on journalism skills (despite having marketing colleagues submit a draft of their ‚Äúnews story‚Äù and having to edit/re-write it to be serious internal news for our corporate intranet channel.) 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm burned out, lost my writing skills but I just freeze up figuring out what/where the story angle should be, how to copy edit/rewrite and get inside my head. 

It takes me forever to finish and I often miss deadlines. 

Anyways, here‚Äôs the original post below. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I would like as many resources that you can think of/provide. 

Both journalistic and strategic communications/PR. 

I‚Äôm looking to strengthen my writing but perhaps I need to go back to the basics with grammar/sentence structure and figure out my style.

My boss loves to overwrite/edit my work but provide no additional support or feedback as to why, just the ‚Äúyou should know this, just look at my edits and create a cheat sheet.‚Äù 

Currently, I‚Äôm in internal communications and we do a lot of internal news writing about the company, I‚Äôm also curious as far as copy-editing b/c most of our submissions are copy editing from marketing team into journalistic news stories (inverted pyramid, finding the right angle). But I also have a boss who relies on me (nobody else) to check everything. I‚Äôm drowning in content, tbh so I make mistakes.

Also ‚Äî if a colleague sends bullet points or if I‚Äôm assigned to write a email memo or quick internal post, I struggle with getting started, creativity/inspiration while keeping in straight news and taking forever missing deadlines b/c I‚Äôm also trying to pay attention to detail. 

I know I should be up to date on AP style rules. Any tips on grammar books, style guides, writing resources - journalistic or PR and basic rules I should‚Äôt forget.

I have on-site credentials and have to report on games, however I'm not paid by my company to go to these games. Again, only a per-article basis. But my commute and gas had added another expense. 

With each passing day, I am growing more uncomfortable that I'm being potentially taken advantage of. I also feel horrible cause I am earning extremely little. What do you think of the situation I'm in? I just don't know if it's reasonable for me to be upset right now.

If I wanted to earn more money, I'd have to go absolutely balls to the wall every day and churn out articles like crazy. But even then with their quota, I'd only be earning less than $500 a month.

They want me to dedicate more time and put out more articles, but not only is burnout hitting me hard, I still have to make time for my other jobs. Again, all three combined don't get me near a living wage. :( So I'm having to debate a fourth.

I know this is a PR strategy so they can anticipate the news cycle, but I can't afford to waste my time waiting for one person to approve and coordinate multiple interview requests on a deadline. 

These PR folks are important contacts for me and I often contact them directly if I don't already know which source I need, so I need to have a good relationship with them. What can I say to them to help them understand why this is a problem without losing their respect? Personally, I feel like funneling media requests through one person inhibits quality, candid journalism from happening.

Is it appropriate to contact these people for an interview?

On another, the topic itself holds so much traumatic potential in it that it may be hard for one to open up.  


I thought to myself that it may be harder for trans men to report the harassment they've received due to wanting to live a stealth life and on the other hand having to conform to the gender stereotypes of being strong and macho.

On the other hand, trans women may face both sexual harassment and harassment on their gender. Especially considering that one often has to write abotu controversial or dangerous topics as a journalist, one may be in an even more vulnerable position.

I've currently been working at a local regional newspaper in Australia for eighteen months. I've really enjoyed the work, but I'm stuck at the moment. I'm away from my family and the dating pool is terrible for someone who's quite intellectual like me. I haven't really made any friends, partly because the demographics skew older up here. So it's getting harder and harder for me to stay. 

I'm looking for new jobs, but jobs in newspapers seem a bit thin on the ground, especially when I haven't been doing it for that long. And this job has been pretty good. I generally run the EGN part of the newspaper, I allocate stories, take photos, I get to choose what I report on and how I report on it. But jobs that require my experience don't seem to be around much. 

So where do I go from here?

There's jobs that want digital journalists, which I take to mean they want multimedia skills, but I've only really done writing and photography. I did a bit of audio in my degree, but that's it. Could I transition into a job that wants radio and video-based content as well?

142,17f04ko,coleslawjourney,2023-10-24 00:48:47+00:00,Dealing with a bad editor?,"Title is fairly self-explanatory. The managing editor at my publication truly makes my job (and the jobs of my fellow reporters) a living hell. This is my first post-grad full-time journalism job, and I‚Äôve been at it for about six months. When I was in J-school and at past internships, I was blessed - spoiled, really - with some fantastic, empathetic editors who also were treasure troves of wisdom and experience. One was a Pulitzer winner, etc. Just super great editors. 

The editor I work under now plays favorites to the max - they (I‚Äôm using gender neutral pronouns to protect their identity) oftentimes don‚Äôt even edit the stories of one of our reporters who they like, which almost every day leads to that reporter‚Äôs stories being published with spelling errors, incorrect information, wrong names, etc., which reflects poorly on ALL of us and reduces our paper‚Äôs credibility. The editor in question also tends to be INCREDIBLY moody and just downright mean sometimes. Also is just terrible at, well, managing and editing. Can be downright biased and often edits the teeth out of our stories. Has right-wing beliefs that sometimes seep into our paper. They constantly promise to give us training, help, etc., but never follow through on those promises. They ask for feedback on what we think needs to change in the newsroom, but has never once implemented any of those changes or tried to make improvements.

I again want to emphasize that the biggest problem is that they‚Äôre often just downright mean, rude, and critical without being constructive, which just stresses all of us out to the max and leaves us constantly on edge wondering what we‚Äôre going to get berated for next. That‚Äôs really hard particularly for me as a recent grad - I‚Äôm trying so hard to build up my confidence only for it to constantly be shot down by my direct superior. I‚Äòm giving this job EVERYTHING I have, trying so hard to build a solid reputation, and working to deliver important information to the community. It‚Äôs just such a shame because I‚Äôm in a lovely area of the country, and EVERYONE else in my newsroom are beyond lovely individuals who I‚Äôve grown close with. But I just cannot shake the unending toxicity of my editor. It‚Äôs burning me out FAST. And I‚Äôm not the only one - our paper has a big problem with staff turnover, and I suspect that the editor plays a big part in that (in addition to all the other typical problems with local news that cause people to leave their jobs). I know I‚Äôve considered quitting multiple times just in the past six months, but I‚Äôm stuck in a lease in this city until the spring and I don‚Äôt just want to give up.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how have you all dealt with bad editors in your careers? I‚Äôm trying to find a balance between sticking up for myself and setting boundaries when they say or do something out of pocket, but I also want to eventually leave this job on good terms with good references. Don‚Äôt wanna burn any bridges.

145,17ex1p2,InvestorMonitor,2023-10-23 22:26:47+00:00,Dealing with anxiety about corrections?!,"Ok I might be crazy, I am not sure if correction anxiety is a thing that others feel or if it just me‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve been a staff reporter for a few years and now I am freelance. I am so careful. I triple check names, titles, company descriptions, quotes, hyperlinks and yet no matter careful I am,  I usually get at least one correction or update request per article. If it‚Äôs a big feature, it could be 3-4 requests. 

I feel absolutely awful if i make a genuine mistake, however, most of the time they are only small changes. Sometimes I even think some companies are pedantic about requesting corrections, especially if the article is critical of them.

When I was on staff, dealing with the anxiety of publishing a story and handling the corrections was somewhat manageable as I had easy access to the editor and I knew the editor knew me and understood that I was hard worker who cared deeply about accurate reporting and did good work.

But now I am freelance, the anxiety really eats at me. I am on edge waiting to see what people want fixed for the first 24 hours after the article is published. It sometimes even takes the joy out of publishing a great story. For example, this week I published a feature with perspectives of 14+ sources (not all featured) and waiting to hear from them all on what might need changed makes me so anxious. It‚Äôs even worse if I have a story come out on the weekend and I can‚Äôt get quick access to the editor to make a fix then its ruining my day off.

I think the anxiety comes from caring about representing things accurately and I am  also worried about having to go back to an editor that I don‚Äôt know that well with multiple update requests and whether it will impact with my reputation with them, especially if its a pub I care about.

I am sorry for rambling on about this but I have no idea who to talk to about this. I am not even sure how many correction or update requests journalists typically deal with per story, especially if the stories have more critical angles.

I feel the curiosity to do it for its impact potential and the fact that you're covering some of the most important issues at hand - but the thing about me is that I don't think I've ever had a ""natural"" interest in politics -- meaning, I don't spend my free time catching up on the latest issues in Congress, spend free time reading on foreign affairs, etc. 

Before I even think about investing time and money down this path, please give me the straightforward pros and cons, if you have experience or know of others on this path! It would help me a lot to hear from others on any insights they may have. 

For more info, I'm currently pretty content with where I am on the entertainment/general news path - but you KNOW, the grass seems always greener on the other side...and I'm wondering if covering the most important issues in politics would make me feel like I'm making more impact, etc. It would be a major pivot for sure, so all insight is welcomed!

I did this via email, which I was not thrilled about, but it's the only way they have to submit tips other than by phoning them. I told them why I was submitting the tip (public interest and follow-up to a series of articles they ran), provided a link to their article, and told them I have official documentation which provides proof of what I'm telling them. I didn't send the documentation as I first wanted a response. Didn't want to send it into the vortex. Because, yes, this is a huge risk to me but given the coverage the issue has received, and the effect on a significant number of residents of the city, it's probably an important story. Absolutely no response. Nothing. How long do I wait before I say to myself, guess they're not interested? And if they're not interested, is it worth the effort of sending it to another local news org? Should I have included the documentation in the email?

First time posting here‚ÄîI'm a freelance journalist based out of Chicago with a B.S. in biochemistry and M.S. in journalism. I just finished graduate school in June 2023 and finished my undergrad in June 2020. Currently working a freelance contract for a project that will wrap up next month but need guidance with attaining a full-time job.

In addition to graduating into a pandemic, I've been dealing with health issues since about 2019 and couldn't (even though I would have loved to) work any sort of job from 2019 to about early 2023. My health has improved and I have published more (and better, lol) stories, across formats, in the past year than I did in any one year stint at my undergrad newsroom.

I know this industry is very difficult to break into and very low paying, I thought I came to terms with that and I certainly don't think I'm entitled to a job, but I have worked terribly hard to get to this point and faced lots of rejection in the past few months.

I need to find full time work by this time next year as I cannot live without health insurance (will be 26 and medicaid  hardly covers any of the medications/visits I need). I truly don't have an ounce of passion for any other line of work but with the low pay and amount of turnover, should I start considering a different career for more stability with my health?

I think my r√©sum√© and online portfolio could use a lookover by people/journalists with experience who  have some distance from my work and can give me honest feedback. I'm very open to criticism and enjoy being edited, so if this is of interest to you please comment or DM and I will share!

\**Will likely delete this post in a couple of days\**

211,17adrw3,RecognitionMedium277,2023-10-18 00:49:41+00:00,Tips for going from MMJ to Print,"Hi friends! 

tldr: I majored in journalism, but currently work in broadcast. I desperately want to be in print, but bc I work in broadcast, I have very little writing examples to prove myself.

So, I majored in plain, ole journalism. My university pushed broadcast SO much. So much so that I was the last person to graduate with a major in journalism because they switched the program to ‚ÄúDigital journalism and broadcasting‚Äù

I was constantly pushed to take broadcast reporting classes, but we had one professor who taught print related classes so I took ALL of them. I even graduated late because of it. So I‚Äôve taken feature writing, podcast, technical writing, etc. 

The job market was slim when I was graduating in December 2022. (I live in Mississippi) So, I did what most stressed college kids do and took the first job I got as an MMJ at a local news station. I‚Äôve been there almost a year, and have 1 year left on my contract.

It is the most toxic place I‚Äôve ever worked. It‚Äôs awful, and I want to leave so bad but ever print job required 3-5 years newsroom experience, some even saying it has to be in long-post journalism. All I have is experience working at my new station and school paper in college. And I obviously haven‚Äôt had any long-post stories be published since I graduated. 

I so badly want to break out of broadcast. What can I do to convince someone to take the chance on me? Where can I find freelance work to add to my portfolio? I will take ANY tips and tricks. Can I take some of my packages and make them into long form and turn that in even if it‚Äôs not published?",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/17adrw3/tips_for_going_from_mmj_to_print/,5,1,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c5618b0>

222,178kztk,jmdglss,2023-10-15 17:59:20+00:00,Why I left TV news,"People often ask me why I left TV news, especially since I was nominated for an investigative reporting Emmy just a few months before I moved on.

I miss a lot about being a full-time journalist. But overall I'm glad I'm not doing it anymore. 

Here's why:

The average number of daily hours of local TV news that stations produce increased by more than 78% over the past 20 years, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2003, stations put on an average of 3.7 hours of news a day, and in 2022 it was up to 6.6. That's not to mention the internet, and the massive workload employees have taken on to keep an increasing amount of content like articles, videos, and social media posts online.

If you think stations increased their staff during that time, you'd be sorely mistaken. In 2020, the¬†number of TV news employees was about the same - just under 30,000 - as it was in 2004, according to Pew. 

Wages have not kept up with inflation. In 2012, Pew said the median wage among TV news analysts, reporters, and journalists was $50,488. By 2020, it increased 11% to $56,140. However, the consumer price index increased by over 13% during that time, meaning in real wages TV journalists took a pay cut.

I made a decent living as an investigative reporter and fill-in anchor in Portland, Oregon where I spent the last 5 and a half years of my career. Before that, I worked as a reporter in Pensacola, Florida, and as a producer/writer at KTTV and KABC in Los Angeles. I spent more than 16 years in the business. 

Work-life balance played a big part in my decision. But more than anything it was having to do way too much work - reporting in multiple shows and expected to deliver unique hits in each one, writing web articles every day, tweeting, Facebook posts, being required to pitch two set-up stories at every morning meeting, which meant working off the clock, and more. I was always working in some way. I was always exhausted. And I was often frustrated.

I still run an investigative news blog, DiscrepancyReport.com, on the side but I do it on my terms and within my own schedule. 

I really wish TV news was a more sustainable career. I wish so many people weren't being so overworked. 

There is a better way. Automation, especially with the use of transcription software (which is not widely used enough), Agile practices, and some more realistic guard rails would help. But the autocratic, boot-on-the-neck management of most news operations could not handle it.

I've always worked extremely hard, and I love facilitating the success of people. An environment that makes success extremely difficult to pull off, however, is not for me.

I love the tech world where new tools and ideas to improve efficiency and sustainability are more welcome. It's part of why the tech industry has been eating the TV news industry's lunch. I'm preparing to launch a career in IT, and I look forward to the change.

Anyone else have a similar experience? What have you had success transitioning into after TV news? How can this business improve? What do you think of my plan?

I've been working as a news reporter for a British publication for nearly eight years now (solidly since a few months after qualifying in 2015). 

We've recently been given a window for voluntary redundancy, and I've been quoted a relatively large sum that would keep me going for more than a year.

I'm minded to take it, but I'm getting married in mid-2024, and, while I won't be paying for the whole thing, ideally I'd like to be gainfully employed by then.

This leads me to my question: is the job market looking alright in the UK for journalists (or even PRs)? I've looked obsessively at job postings, but they can obviously only tell me so much.

Is it concievable that I could find a new job in the next few months or so? I appreciate this is a big question but any insight would be incredibly helpful!

I couldn‚Äôt be happier, but I‚Äôve recently been falling short with my responsibilities.

My depression took over and outside stress related to my line of work from family impacted my mental state which in turn affected my work output (family dislikes the long hours yet very low pay, preferred I work retail or go back to school. I knew what to expect from this industry and I‚Äôm determined to make it. I do care for how they feel though, so it left me feeling doubtful and lost.).

Luckily, my job is pretty lenient. That doesn‚Äôt matter though because I want to have a great reputation in the journalism world. I know I might be wrong, but I feel like I ruined my image before I barely started. I don‚Äôt miss deadlines. I just haven‚Äôt been hitting my quotas. I‚Äôm willing to get back into hitting my quotas each and every single month, but will employers look at my work, notice that I‚Äôve only written a handful of stories per month in a span of a month or two, and see me as unprofessional? Is it too late to redeem myself? What can I do?

Becoming a journalist has been my dream ever since I was in elementary school. I know my shit, and I cannot see myself happy pursuing anything else but journalism and jobs in media. I‚Äôve put in the hard work all these years and opportunities finally came my way, but I feel like I‚Äôve now ruined my chances...",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1785t96/did_i_destroy_my_career_before_it_could_even/,5,4,0.84,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c5eb3a0>

However, I feel this is the right place to ask a question that's been nagging at me for years. What's the difference between culture and lifestyle journalism, and how do I know if I'm one?

Context: I started out as a content writer years ago, until I started writing more fleshed out pieces that required in-depth research and interviews with different sources. Although I have no formal journalism training, I decided to go the journalism route, and as a freelancer it's been fulfilling. But, I've always had a problem with how to describe what type of journalist I am. I write about a variety of topics (art, tech, craft, spirituality, language, fashion, lifestyle, education). 

I used to describe myself as a ""versatile writer"" when I was a content writer, because I also wrote a variety of content for different industries (transportation, fashion, art, music, TV, books, real estate, and more). But, now, as a writer who's seen many journalism tips about niching down, I don't know how to describe what type of writer I am in this field.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/178bt8l/difference_between_lifestyle_and_culture/,5,1,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c5ebd00>

It's not that I wasn't excelling in my role; I covered a substantial beat with a leading news organization in my country, and it marked my first job. Over the years, I contributed more than 1250 stories, ranging from small pieces to detailed investigations.

However, despite the apparent success, I felt compelled to leave. The state of the economy and the challenging landscape of journalism, which often feels like a sinking ship, were causing me anxiety ‚Äì my apologies for the pessimism. The toll on my health was evident; at 26, I was diagnosed as prediabetic and faced numerous hormonal issues. The high-pressure nature of the job had taken a toll on my well-being. So, I began applying for communications positions and other journalism roles.

Surprisingly, many potential employers are puzzled about my decision to leave a prestigious organization and what seemed like a thriving career. I understand that from the outside, journalism might appear glamorous, but those within the field truly comprehend its realities. I also came to the realization that my current workplace was toxic, lacking necessary mentorship and structure. I couldn't continue working without a clear direction, constantly fretting over rejected pitches and struggling to maintain output. Additionally, my meager salary, which ranged from $7,000 to $9,000 over 4.5 years (I'm from a developing country), left me financially strained.

I've come across a promising job opportunity with significantly better pay and the potential for work-life balance. I intend to have a life beyond work, including pursuing dating, as my current job offers no time for personal relationships. However, the prospective employer was astonished at my decision to leave what is often seen as an illustrious career in journalism.

I worked on stories from the courts or current affairs. I was dropped straight into the deep end. I reported from a serious incident on the third day of job, interviewed people etc. It was also a remote job, so other than my editor on the phone, I was alone. 

The news agency produced copy for national newspapers. So I would reiterate it was great experience, except I left during my probation period. I suspect that will be closely scrutinised.

I have a bachelors in psychology and a masters in neuroscience. I know R and Python, I have continued to write in my blog and now I‚Äôm moving onto more data-driven stories. I have managed to get out a couple freelance stories too. 

Unfortunately, due to working, I got out of sync with the NCTJ diploma, and I am absolutely sick of learning online after doing it throughout the pandemic. So I‚Äôve just left it.

I am new to freelance writing, and since I want to do some local journalism to build my portfolio, practice writing about people and events instead of just ideas, and possibly make a bit of money if possible.

As someone who is not new to writing but is very new to journalism, I don't know where to start. What are best practices for contacting news outlets? Should I send written articles, or pitches? Do small local papers usually pay, or is it usually volunteer? Are there any good places where I can learn more about style? Are there any ethical mistakes that every new journalist makes?

260,177b82u,sonderweg74,2023-10-13 22:58:04+00:00,Obituary Standards,"I have a question on obituary standards. First, some background:

I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania. I do not live there any more, but I check the obituaries to see who has died. This is mostly for former teachers and parents of classmates. Today, I saw the obituary for a former teacher. This wasn't any normal teacher. After I had graduated, he was arrested and convicted of sex crimes against two underage males (he was involved in Boy Scouts and the Outdoor Club).  The obituary mentioned none of this. I didn't expect it would, as it was submitted by his friends/family. But it did paint an awfully rosy portrait of the teacher, about how great he was with kids, etc. 

Seeing this, I wrote the following email to the generic ""news"" address:

> I am wondering what the *Gettysburg Times*' policy is regarding publishing obituaries of known offenders. You recently published an obituary for James B. Dickinson Jr. Notably absent from his obituary  was the fact that he was convicted of sexual offenses against minors     in 1998; this was a top story in the *Times* in 1997-98.     Unless he was released very recently, he spent the rest of his life     in prison. I realize that the obituary was likely provided by an     outside source, but I am disappointed that it paints a rosy portrait     of a known offender in the Gettysburg community. No doubt there are     victims reading this obituary and feeling forgotten.  
   
>  
>For reference, here is the link to your article from his conviction:     [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0JMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t-YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5514%2C2480001](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0JMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t-YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5514%2C2480001) 

I received the following unsigned reply: 

>Obits are paid ads. If you don't like it, buy an ad yourself.¬†

I figured this was sent by some low-level staffer who was tired of these types of emails. I replied to the editor, and copied the publisher:

&#x200B;

>...The response I received from your staff seems unnecessarily curt and more than a tinge hostile. Is that how your staff normally answers sincere questions from the public?  
>  
>I should also add, it doesn't really answer my question, unless the implication is that the *Gettysburg Times* accepts any and all ads.  I seriously doubt that is true.  

I got this reply from the editor:

&#x200B;

> First off, it's not Mr. \[*This was my mistake*\]  
>  
>Second, I wrote that response.  
>  
>Third, despite being a criminal he is still entitled to die and have an obit.  
>  
>Don't know that I can make it any simpler. I am sorry you are upset. No one forced you to read the obit.

What is going on here? Do newspapers really have no standards when it comes to this type of thing?Yes, I know they are ads, but I figured there would be some sort of filter. If not, can I have place an ad for *anything*? I seriously doubt it.

In light of the recent apparent End of the End of History, and the rise of ubiquitous misinformation in recent years more generally, I thought Mastodon could be positioned as a place to follow individual journalists and trustworthy newsgathering organizations.

It could become, in effect, the public radio equivalent of Twitter.

I thought this might be a doable thing. Mastodon is not-for-profit, and it wouldn't be hard to make a front-end/onboarder site for new Mastodon users which pointed them to journalists generally agreed upon to produce accurate and relatively unbiased reporting.

It could just be a simple, clean, somewhat shiny website that lists useful accounts and somehow connects users to one of Mastodon's servers.

ChatGPT could build the onboarder website with basic instructions. I honestly think the project would only take about three days.

Anyway, maybe opinion on r/Journalism will be against this. Maybe you all won't think it's worth bothering with. Please let me know, either way. I'd love to direct the project myself, frankly. I'd even do it, I just don't have time right now.

Thanks very much for reading, in any case, and I hope you're all having a great day.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/176uydl/is_it_possible_to_position_mastodon_as_the_public/,8,5,0.78,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c6764c0>

272,1766gsi,FleckoTheFly,2023-10-12 13:02:20+00:00,"After 10 years in journalism, it's hard to know if anything will get better","I am probably the closest I've ever been to outright quitting journalism to pursue another career, at least for a time. I have a very good salary, and I have built a good reputation for myself with the beats I cover, but the lack of resources has been very demoralizing. 

I have been in my current job for a total of nearly five years. When I first started covering my main beat, I barely knew nothing about it, but over the years, I learned a lot and became a subject matter expert, which has made me somewhat of a must-read reporter for the industry I cover.  

I'm now at the point where I've had three well-regarded publications and one analyst firm reach out to me for potential jobs related to my coverage area.

I ended up taking a job with one of those publications early last year, but it didn't last longer than a year. We had to write two to three articles a day, and I was covering a fairly complex topic. But the hardest part was that my supervisor turned out to be a toxic person. Let's just say they stressed me out so much that I had a hard time going to sleep every night because I was constantly anticipating confrontations with this person. And this was happening while I wasn't getting much sleep in the first place due to having an infant who was only three- to four-months old. 

I had never left a journalism job less than a year after starting it. In fact, for almost every successive job in my career, I stayed there longer than the last. But especially as a new father who wants to be present with his family when away from work, the high level of stress just wasn't worth it.

I was lucky that my former publication was very happy to take me back fairly quickly. I may have considered a job outside of journalism to get out of the other place otherwise. The problem is, while I was gone, the old publication wasn't happy with the person who replaced me, so they fired that person and then folded my old job into another person's job.

I ended up taking over that job, which combined my old beat with two other major beats. Several months later, I have increasingly felt that this has held me back from focusing on original reporting and writing stories that would increase the profiles of myself and my publication. There is simply too much news coming from these three beats, and there is an expectation that I stay on top of most of these news developments. This has led to a large backlog of features and interviews from the past several months that I originally thought I had the time to complete. 

What's most frustrating is that if I were able to do more original reporting, it would help show other people what I was capable of and what aspects of my main beat I found most interesting. This would potentially help me with finding a better job for the future, but instead, I feel like I'm just treading water and wasting the years away. It seems that the only way for me to stay sane in this job is to lose my ambition and accept that stagnation is the status quo.

I talked to my supervisor twice to see if the company would be open to hiring another person and restoring my original position. I have believed that doing so would help the publication attract many more loyal readers. But it seems that the budget situation is bad enough that my supervisor said they are focused on fighting to ensure that no one on the editorial team gets laid off next year. 

After reading this [article](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/10/five-former-journalists-on-why-they-left-the-industry/) on Nieman Journalism lab about why five former journalists left the industry, I finally realized that maybe I should quit too. My family life has become much more important to me, and the idea of not having to deal with recurring burnout is very attractive. It's also hard to know if things would improve substantially if I were to go to another publication at this point. The good jobs where journalists can focus on original reporting are very far and few between. 

Anyhow, that's my rant, and if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I don't know if I'm looking for advice, but I'd be happy to hear stories of other people dealing with similar situations.

I‚Äôm currently working as a full time cadet reporter for my local town, which I have been doing for nearly two years now.
I started the job with no prior experience or study, so I‚Äôm still pretty fresh in a few areas.
What I wanted to get off my chest is the way I feel about the type of work I have been doing recently.
For the past few months, I have probably been the one to do all of the smaller community based stories.
These are easy enough and usually don‚Äôt take that much time, but sometimes I can‚Äôt help but think if this is all I will be doing for the rest of my career.
Recently I‚Äôve wanted to do more in terms of ‚Äúhard news‚Äù stories, which my co-workers tend to be more experienced in.
I talked with a few of them a while ago to see if there was a chance I could look into a few of the bigger leads, which didn‚Äôt go as planned.
They said I needed to get the basics down packed in terms of style and writing, which I completely understand.
However, I don‚Äôt really understand how I am supposed to learn more about the field if I can‚Äôt be more involved in it.
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a trust issue or purely for convenience, but if experience is the issue, then I don‚Äôt get how at least attempting the story would be a problem.
In the past I have done hard news stories before, and from the feedback I did a pretty decent job, so it‚Äôs obviously not because I can‚Äôt do it.
Because of this, I‚Äôve recently started to lose motivation for my work, as a whole.

I've always loved writing and in the last few years have really developed an interest in journalism. It's hard to imagine ever fully changing careers but I'm also not the type to not follow my interests. This is an impulse strategy that has worked well for me throughout my adult life.

So, with no journalism education, I know my first step must be to familiarize myself with the fundamentals. So, I wonder if anyone here has done any part-time, online journalism courses? There are quite a few on coursera. I imagine they're not terrible but some are probably better than others. 

[https://www.coursera.org/search?query=journalism&](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=journalism&)

I won't need to get feedback or have my assignments graded because, lucky me, I have two relatives that are quite renowned journalists and I'm sure they'd happily pick apart my practice pieces. 

Also, if anyone has a list of assignments that I could do myself, like first year journalism 101 type stuff, I'd love to see it.

I'm not sure what I'm looking to get out of this endeavour other than to dip my toe in. I know the field is pretty tough employment-wise so I don't have any illusions in that regard. 

I have pretty grim feelings about the state of our western democracies and I know good journalism will continue to be critical if our society is to survive and thrive. (Which sounds melodramatic, but there you have it)...

The story in question was published about 11 years ago. I am not personally named in the story. Rather, the story is about somebody that had wronged me. I'll spare you all the bullshit. But basically, this guy had infringed on a copyrighted work on which I was a collaborator. The work itself was nearly 10 years old at the time of the incident. I'm long over it. The perpetrator has moved on to a new industry. He reached out to me recently, asking if I could request that the article be removed. His reason was that Google searches of his name tend to bring up this article, and it is having an adverse effect on his job prospects. My first instinct is to say, well, tough luck. But the situation didn't affect me (really, any of us) much in the first place. If anything, it was a mild annoyance. And I hate the idea of somebody else suffering because of a stupid mistake they made over a decade ago that never really hurt anyone. We've all been young and stupid. I'm just old enough to have gotten most of my sins in before the internet was around to immortalize them. As far as I'm concerned, he's done his time. He lost the career he had at the time and faced ostracization from his community.

One thing slightly complicating things on my end is that (due to something unrelated) I am no longer on speaking terms with all of the other collaborators. I don't really want to make a unilateral decision about reaching out to the publication. But I am also not so keen on re-opening old wounds just to clean my conscience‚Äîfeels like I'll be getting into some really counter-productive territory.

In 2018, while working for the Beverly Press,¬†[I wrote a feature story about the Formosa Cafe](https://beverlypress.com/2018/09/famous-hollywood-cafe-prepares-for-its-second-act/)¬†in West Hollywood as it prepared for its reopening.

Last week, editor/owner Karen Villalpando¬†[published a story about the Formosa Cafe](https://beverlypress.com/2023/09/meet-me-at-the-formosa/). Six and a half out of 11 paragraphs of her story were copied verbatim from my original story, but my work was not credited.

Since Karen was named Print Journalist of the Year by the LA Press Club back in June, I assumed she would want to rectify a blatant act of plagiarism with an editor's note that appropriately credited my original reporting. I sent the email in the screenshot attached.

Instead, she had an attorney send me a¬†[cease and desist email](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24004867-letter-to-luke-harold_10323)¬†that threatened a defamation lawsuit if I continue¬†[to post about Karen's plagiarism on Twitter](https://twitter.com/luke_harold/status/1707462347659559011)¬†or communicate with anyone about it.¬†

I already violated their cease and desist letter with three more tweets (and this reddit post). If they follow through on the lawsuit, I imagine it would be the first time an American media outlet filed a lawsuit in defense of an act of plagiarism. Feels bizarre, ironic and surreal that a newspaper editor would fight so passionately for her legal right to plagiarize a former employee while ignoring the ethical obligation as a journalist to not plagiarize.

Their attorney also appears to conflate copyright infringement with plagiarism. I'm not claiming any ownership of the article. I'm only claiming an ethical breach, given that plagiarism is considered a mortal sin in journalism and virtually all legitimate news outlets have a zero-tolerance policy for it.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/17425c6/i_called_out_my_former_editor_for_plagiarizing_my/,35,38,0.89,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17c76c2e0>

I‚Äôm the EIC of my high school‚Äôs news publication and our high school has seen a rise in incidents of hate speech among students.

Our admin doesn‚Äôt publicly release the exact data on hate speech incidents and for privacy reasons, they can‚Äôt tell us the names of victims so we are looking to gather student perspectives. We wanted to host a town hall/open forum where anyone could come in and share their experiences but the reality is, our school population is on the apathetic side and getting people to sacrifice lunch time to attend this kind of event let alone share their experiences would be difficult. Our other idea was making an anonymous Google Form that asks questions about student experiences with bias but from past experiences with Google Forms, it‚Äôs difficult to get HS students to answer open ended google forms. 

Does anyone have any ideas for how we can go about starting a dialogue regarding the prevelance of bias in our school community that students would be responsive to? Are there any ways we could incentivize students that don‚Äôt involve money? 

Covering this is really important to us since it‚Äôs an elephant in the room issue we‚Äôve largely ignored.

I'm on a very competitive early-career programme at a national newspaper in Europe \[I won't specify which, but e.g. equivalent to the Washington Post\]. This is my first full-time job, apart from some temporary journalism freelancing as a student / recent graduate etc. 

It's been amazing in many ways, with lots of bylines, opportunities, great newsroom colleagues + connections. Very exciting and I've learned a huge amount. 

However, I feel quite burned-out, tired, and lacking in inspiration. I do my job fine and get good feedback. But inside I feel so anxious, having to represent myself in the intense atmosphere to stressed editors. I also have realised I really don't like general reporting, all the unpredictability and late nights. I feel like my personality type is 'wrong', that I'm not tough & cynical enough. 

Lots of people seem to idealise the pace and intensity of journalism, or long for the nostalgic days of being a cub reporter starting out ... but I'm feeling like I don't want it any more.

323,171i2ft,CorsicanWildcard,2023-10-06 17:16:01+00:00,One month into my master‚Äôs degree in journalism and I‚Äôm TOTALLY disillusioned,"A year ago I was that person researching all over the internet questions like ‚Äúshould I get a master‚Äôs in journalism?‚Äù and most of the responses said no. Without any formal training in journalism I decided it would be a good idea anyway. I got into a dual degree program at a very good university where one side of the degree is journalism and the other is European politics. I have a master‚Äôs in international relations already. 

So much that the professors/advisors have said about working in journalism has given me a really bad feeling about the profession. Like how freelancing (even with our expensive degree) is probably what we‚Äôre going to do, especially at the beginning of our careers. One of my professors said a good idea for us would be to do journalism work for an NGO. I could‚Äôve worked at an NGO with my previous master‚Äôs. 

Another thing that really bothered me recently was the way my professor approached a news assignment. I went to a panel discussion on an important local issue, wrote an article about it, and the professor‚Äôs feedback was that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnewsy‚Äù enough and I needed to completely redo the assignment and go to another event. Didn‚Äôt even critique my writing. I went to another event and the response was the same‚Äî‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not news.‚Äù How was it not news??? It was an event where people talked about important issues and I asked questions and then wrote about it and that‚Äôs not news? 

Pretty much every day I‚Äôm fantasizing about quitting the journalism degree and finishing only the European politics degree. I love studying/writing about what‚Äôs going on in Europe and I‚Äôm honestly really knowledgeable about the region. It would save me a year of my life and about $40k of tuition. I‚Äôm afraid that decision might haunt me but if I already hate it one month in, is that a bad sign?? 

Anyone out there with a journalism-y job without an actual journalism degree? That was always my goal but now I‚Äôm completely disillusioned thinking that the type of job I‚Äôm looking for might not even exist, or that a journalism degree isn‚Äôt the way to get there. My ‚Äúdream job‚Äù would be researching and writing for a publication like Foreign Policy. 

I‚Äôm so scared to get out there and just be a journalist without the security of a master‚Äôs on my resume, even if I‚Äôd have two other master‚Äôs in different fields.

(no details other than that for privacy reasons, sorry haha)

the staff just finished our next issue after seven months and after my advisor sends it off to be printed, she‚Äôs alerted by the school that they won‚Äôt be printing any further student publications. no explaination, no details, nothing. just sent back without any reasoning. the person who alerted our advisor didn‚Äôt even make the decision, but he also won‚Äôt tell us who DID so we can take action. 

i‚Äôve already written a letter to the one who delivered the news but i‚Äôm not sure where to turn next. the president of the school? one of the many deans? stand outside their office with a stack of the last 15 years of magazines?!?! or is it really the death of print forever and thus is just the changing tide?

It's just that the stories happen to be true. One of the most profound powers of storytelling is its ability to help people understand themselves. I want to tell true stories that help people understand themselves. 

There's just one problem: where the hell do I find stories like that?

I'm specifically planning on being a travel writer with undercurrents/aspirations of literary journalism: though I'd enjoy writing works that integrate people into the democratic process and the broader context of their communities and societies, I don't have the balls for hardcore investigative journalism or the temperament to work in a large media company. It's easy enough (though expensive) to find a place with a rich cultural history and travel there: it's hard to find [the amateur linguist whose rapid rise in popularity found him in the same room as Ukraine's second most wanted terrorist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners) out of the millions of people that inhabit that place (the example article is how I want to write and my inspiration for going into journalism, though I don't really want to be in situations as dangerous as those described). Since I'm hoping to minor in philosophy of science, I might focus on a country's research institutions and find a niche in science communication, though opportunities for a more creative nonfiction-oriented style would be limited in that case. 

Is there a process for finding stories that take me off the beaten path? What should I look for when doing research? How do I recognize when I've found something interesting?

I graduated with a BS in Journalism in 2021. I grew an interest in journalism since high school and I was a dedicated writer for my high school‚Äôs newspaper. Towards the end of high school into college my interests shifted and I started pursuing video journalism and now I work in the documentary industry. I‚Äôm not making my own films yet, but hope is to be a documentary filmmaker so I am happy where I‚Äôm at.

But recently I‚Äôve become more interested in investigative reporting. My first internship was working alongside an investigative reporter and I loved working there, it is probably my favorite internship I‚Äôve had and that was in 2018.

I feel stuck with how to get back into investigative journalism. My biggest obstacle is that I have no published bylines. I felt very confident in my writing in high school, but in college I came to the conclusion that I‚Äôm not a great writer. I had two very renowned professors that were amazing teachers and really wanted the best for their students. Each assignment would come back with so many edits and it came so naturally to others, I got discouraged, began to hate writing and then stopped altogether.

I‚Äôd love to make investigative documentaries but that requires a lot of money and equipment upfront. And in the documentary world I work with independent filmmakers mostly, so I don‚Äôt have connections to major newspaper publications‚Äô video teams or the LA streaming services‚Äô documentary teams. My hope is to be able to merge the two and I even have a passion project for a documentary that is investigative reporting as well.

I would like to become a professional journalist/opinion writer and I would like some advice from people much more experienced than I am.

First, to specify some things according to the requirements of the ""Getting Into Journalism Post Guidelines"":

* Online print journalism is what I'm trying to get into.
* I would like to be a freelance writer with an emphasis on writing long-form content and OP-eds. The areas that I have some expertise in are literary analysis, politics and psychology (for which I went to college).
* I have no official experience, however I do have a lot of unofficial experience. I started writing fiction in 2010. I started my own website alongside a partner who studied journalism back in 2019 where I published one to two articles a week on the topic of popular media. That website is no longer active because my partner wanted to quit. Since the website was taken down I've written some articles on medium. Some of these are about popular media, other are on the topic of politics. I am a huge political junkie and consume lots of political content myself and have been doing this for almost 10 years, so I am well-informed. And I studied psychology at a university so I have some expertise when it comes to that topic as well.
* I live in the European Union/European Economic Area.

All that being said, there are basically three things I'd like to know:

1. How do I actually go about selling my first article? As in, finding someone willing to buy it and closing the deal. *Edit: Just to be clear, I know you generally pitch an article and don't just sell a full article. I meant I would like somewhat of a breakdown of the steps and how to complete them successfully from the first contact to the moment I get paid.*
2. How many articles can I reasonably expect to sell within the first year?
3. Just in general, how can I get my name out there as a writer/journalist to the people who might be interested in hiring me?

Thank you in advance everyone who will comment here. Becoming a professional writer is a lifelong dream so I very much appreciate any help.

*Edit: Just to be clear, I'm asking for specifics here. Detail. And I know I can look up information elsewhere. I have done that, but I haven't found the answers I've been looking for or not to the level of specificity I've been looking for. So please don't just answer ""Look this up"" or some variation of that.*

I work as a journalist at a small Publishing Company in ontario, putting out five local newspapers per week. Our traffic tanked after meta stopped us from posting links to our stories, and although we tried to get into Twitter marketing, musk's mistreatment of the platform has stymied that as well.

We were considering a few different options to increase our traffic:

1. Adopting SEO practices in our writing to increase organic search results
2. Holding a contest or quiz online and Publishing the answer in the physical paper.
3. Getting into video journalism.

SEO is not our first choice, both because we were afraid our journalists might resort to keyword stuffing which would reduce the quality of our articles, and because our coverage area is small and nobody's really doing an organic search to find news

The contest would be expensive in terms of prizes, and it would be just a short-term Band-Aid solution unless we ran a new contest multiple times.

Video journalism seems like the most appealing option. Posting a new video for each newspaper every week that summarizes the top stories and directs people to the website that could be cross-posted between facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and tiktok. One of our journalists has experience in broadcasting and has a studio in his basement

365,16zgkla,crazylikeajellyfish,2023-10-04 07:17:40+00:00,Where's the line between photojournalism & posting on social media?,"There was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16yzq5t/can_someone_get_paid_to_share_their_story/) where somebody was asking for a paycheck to share their story and got rightly criticized.  If you pay for people telling stories, then you're going to get a lot of stories -- not true ones.

That said, I have wondered about how people may be compensated for the recordings they put out through social media.  The protests in the summer of 2020 might not have happened if it weren't for Darnella Frazier filming George Floyd's murder.  How many ad dollars got spent around coverage featuring her footage, and how many of those dollars went to her?  She got like >$700k via GoFundMe, but CNN's ad revenue was \~$2.3M per day at the time -- lots of money flowing, all spurred by her video.

It's pretty clear that paying somebody to tell a story isn't real journalism, but would it be against ethics for outlets to compensate Darnella Frazier by licensing her recording?  I know it isn't legally required, as the recording is publicly available and and newsworthy.  From an industry ethics perspective, though, where's the line between what she did and freelance photojournalism?

Edit: I know proposing that publications pay more makes no sense given the state of the industry; more thinking about whether a publication could build a brand on the premise of paying whoever made the recording.

I am someone with a visual impairment who was recently fired from my non-journalist day job in the DC area. Prior to this, I was working in a Southern state in an unrelated field. During that time, I interned overnight with a company based out of East Asia that did cultural reporting - things like sports news, food, tech pieces, this sort of thing.

I have some money to pay my rent through December, but its going to be tight and I'd like to pick up a part time job as a night reporter or weekend reporter. I know these are less stressful, and broadly speaking easier to obtain than full time work. I figure that even at a less reputable org, it would still be pub credits that I can use to get a job with a more respected outlet as long as I play my cards right. 

I'm not going to name particular outlets I am thinking of working with, but I'm sure we all know that one side of the aisle has a lot more media spend than the other, a lot louder of a megaphone. A lot of my prior experience around East Asia-related reporting (China and Taiwan, mostly) has been met with silence by most US outlets..  Was I doing some different style of journalism or something.???

When I present my portfolio to hiring managers they tell me I ""wasn't a journalist, you were a copy writer"", this was from an outlet whose line I typically respect. I interviewed people, I researched leads, I broke news. Maybe it wasn't politics related, but I was up at 3am writing a press release during the Tokyo Olympics to make a deadline for my editor. 

How does someone like me re-enter the world of journalism without going freelance? I need a steady paycheck, and I don't have the network or clout to where I can just call up people and say ""I have a story that fits your paper"".. I have stories ready to publish, but after 20 quieries, no one bites.

I am a journalism student and the managing editor for my school's newspaper. My school's journalism program has been around since the '60s, was well-regarded for a long time and the newspaper has won several awards over the decades.

Before COVID-19 (and before my time here), the journalism students had a good relationship with the college's Board of Directors (BoD) and Students' Association (SA). They regularly had meetings with them, did interviews and got story ideas. However, from what I have heard, there were interpersonal issues within the BoD and SA during the lockdowns which resulted in most of them resigning or getting fired. No conflicts, from what I have been told, were a result of the journalism program. (Though judging by some of their responses, I can't know if that's true or not.)

Since then, almost the entirety of the staff from the BoD and SA has changed and most of them either don't care to interact with the school newspaper or don't know it exists. Those who know we exist have told us, ""we're not allowed to talk to you.""

Unfortunately, coinciding with this, the school newspaper turned solely digital, and since many of the programs here are only one to three years long, most students now have no idea what our \[newspaper name\] is.

Or I could pursue journalism which (industry side) I know practically nothing about and any college I attend would need to be online to fit with my chaotic work schedule. 

What I really want is to one day write stories about different cultures abroad, activism, conflict, or anything else that sparks an interest. What‚Äôs holding me back is living paycheck to paycheck and having a roommate, my SO, and my cats relying on me to keep bills paid.

I'm writing this post in hopes that I could get some advice, as I'm currently trying to decide what carrer path I should take.

&#x200B;

So, I'm a foreign languages and cultures student (gonna graduate soon), and  I have to decide how to continue with my studies (I'm from Europe, in university we have many degrees where you start with 3 years and then you specialize in something regarding that initial degree for 2 years usually). For a really long while, I was really lost and didn't have a clue on what to do.

Today though I came up, thanks to some advice, with something that I would actually be interested in pursuing, and that would be cinema journalism. I actually like writing and reviewing texts since high school (which was focused on classical subjects) and i love cinema, I love experiancing a movie and espressing my opinion and analyzing details and the style of a certain director.

With my degree I can access the journalism courses available. Also, I researched some newspapers that write about cinema in my country and I was thinking about sending to a few of them an email where I expressed my interest in the job and asked for some details about it.

Anyway, would this be a good carrer? Is it something that someone with my interests can enjoy? Do you any advice on the skills that I should acquire?

&#x200B;

So my question is who are some writers who have done work similar to Didion who ""tak\[e\] any notice at all of California's Latinos and Asians""?

I have a civil rights journalism story. It is an incredibly powerful story. It‚Äôs a story that deserves publicity. For often, publicity brings truth and frees the innocent. 

I have to do this on a very tight budget. I also am not asking for authorship.  Probably, the correct thing to do would be to put me as an author and add an editor.

She would love an investigator to come and look through all the evidence of all sides of the story, and produce an honest report. For some reason that seems incredibly difficult to arrange.

I‚Äôve been in journalism for going on four years now and like a whole lot of y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm sure, I‚Äôm starting to feel like this career is a dead end at worst, and a cul-de-sac at best. 

I spent nearly three years at a local news outlet with all the quality of life complaints one might expect. I‚Äôm now at a more specialized outlet ‚Äî one could almost call it a trade pub ‚Äî that has vastly improved my work-life balance and salary, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this too will burn me out eventually. Writing now feels far closer to technical writing than it does reporting, and I can‚Äôt see myself staying at my current job long term and not going crazy from boredom. That‚Äôs to say nothing of the macro trends in this business that look more bleak by the day.

Obviously a lot of us opt to take the nearest adjacent careers when we get out ‚Äî PR, marketing, etc. ‚Äî but has anyone done a hard left turn after working in this industry into something totally unrelated? Some days I seriously contemplate going back to school and taking up something brand new, like ecology or landscape design.

I was married to military and never got to finish my degree in English.

However, was fortunate to get signed on to a small-town newspaper as a sportswriter many years ago. Did that for three years until a military transfer.

Where we were sent was such a small out of the way place I decided to do freelance, and did quite well at it, for about 15 years. Published in many, many regional and national magazines and newspapers.

Worked my way up to Managing Editor of a startup online magazine with a staff of writers and freelancers writing for me.

However, ended up getting a divorce and could no longer afford to do freelancing and/or working for less than I should.

I'm not too sure I want to get back into actual newspaper/news writing, when what I'd really love to do is being a book editor, working in PR and/or marketing, something along those lines, where I can still use my writing, but NOT in journalism.

But everyone wants a degree, and at my age and being as close to retirement as I am, I'm not too sure it would be worth it to do it now.

What are my options, if any, and how do I get people to see my experience IS my college (so to speak?)",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16uxuu8/i_never_got_my_degree_but_my_experience_should/,5,5,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17cbd9ac0>

426,16uk9vy,-SlushPuppy-,2023-09-28 16:16:29+00:00,Story ideas that have been done before in other languages,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice here from some fellow foreign reporters. I'm thinking about pitching a story about a particular business in country X - sort of a profile with a significant current affairs and human interest angle. This company is pretty interesting due to its unique history and the challenging context in which it operates. The thing is, there's a fairly recent article about this place in a major non-English-language publication. In fact, my whole idea for this story was inspired by that article. Now, I'm not looking to simply copy said article (I would obviously do my own research and reporting), but in all likelihood the gist of the piece would end up reading pretty similar. Part of me feels like this is standard practice, yet I'm not quite sure. Any input?

Edit: Just to clarify, the article appeared in another Western (though non-English) news outlet, nothing to do with piggybacking on a story written by a 'native' journalist who lacks the credibility to get his piece placed in a major publication. Think more along the lines of: a major Spanish newspaper has published a piece about an unusual company in Turkey, and I'm looking to get a similar piece about the same company published in an English-language publication.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16uk9vy/story_ideas_that_have_been_done_before_in_other/,1,3,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17cc2d970>

429,16ujlnc,OkStar7207,2023-09-28 15:50:40+00:00,What is the best way to start building an online portfolio as a graduate?,"I graduated last year with a degree in Journalism, Media and Sociology (BA) from a reputable university in the UK. I have been working in my hospitality job since I graduated, it pays ok and I've just had a promotion so it's not the end of the world.

However, I really want to start focusing on how I can start building my portfolio. After looking at many journalism jobs over the past year, it's pretty clear that it is a competitive industry that requires individuals to stand out if they want to be recognised.

But my question is: where do I start? 

Bit of background to my experience at university:

When I went to university three years ago to start my degree, like many, I was not there too long when Covid struck and we was all sent home for the foreseeable. Online learning was the new normal and things were difficult for many. When I first went to university, I was very keen to write for the student newspaper and I did manage to get a couple pieces published. However in the midst of all the pandemic chaos, these opportunities were harder to come by -  Looking back, I wish I did more at the time.

I currently live in a small town and things move pretty slowly down here and the job market is not great. My partner and I are looking to move to London in the future which I think will provide me with better work opportunities in the future.

**So, what is the best way to start building my online portfolio?**

 I have recently started a Wordpress blog about my recent travel in Asia, but I would like to present more than that. Can I upload work on to my portfolio that has not been published anywhere? (for example 'pretend' news articles or even a fictional piece of writing) Can I include some of my photography? 

I appreciate that some of this sounds a bit vague. I personally feel that the support & advice was not as good as it should have been in my final year at university and now I feel pretty lost with where to start. But hey, that's when you turn to Reddit!

Thanks in advance everyone =)

As I understand, working solely as a photographer is becoming increasingly rare, with news organisations preferring to combine photography with other aspects (e.g., writing and/or video) to save money. That being said, I'm willing and able to write relatively well, so I am open to doing that in addition to photography.

Is working solely as a photographer viable anymore, and is moving to a particular hotspot and freelancing (and pitching photos to various outlets) the only way to accomplish this these days? Or is it possible to join a news organisation and then travel to specific regions?

I live in Washington DC, and have prior experience covering entertainment news in Asia (largely, Korea and China). I've applied to several jobs at major news orgs like CNN, Fox, Vox, and I think there was an application to Protocol in there somewhere. 

The 30,000 ft view is as follows:

I am blind, and I graduated with a degree in Political Science during the pandemic in 2020, I had few options so I started a Youtube channel to show my creative/research abilities. In 2021/22, I got brought on to an internship with a media company based in East Asia, where I researched and produced several articles, including a feature piece. Six months ago, I moved to DC to start my first big corporate job, and I get laid off.. I have about 2 months' of rent saved up, and Youtube is nowhere near paying the bills. 

Are there volunteering opportunities I should be taking advantage of? There isn't a particular beat I'd prefer to cover right now, as much as just getting my feet back in the door on this profession.  I'm hungry to chase down leads and speak to people, and not have to worry about rent payments (as much)... Most of my expertise lies in China, Korea, and Central Europe (broadly).. I am not sure how to sell this to an American media outlet. My beat, if you could call it that, was entertainment journalism and tech. There are a few stories I have rattling around in my brain I want to interview people about, but A)I don't know if others would find them compelling and B) Freelancing, especially in/around Washington DC, feels like a fools' errand unless you have a rich family. I can write, I can research, I can produce audio content.. but I need to figure out some way to sell that to people. Would non-major outlets even take on a half blind writer **and** pay me enough to put food on the table?

I am only asking half-jokingly - is this why people become grifters for one cause or another?

Eventually, I want to be a field producer for entertainment and investigative stories, but I know I'll have to move to a bigger market for that in the future. I want to make sure I gain as much experience as possible before I try to move.

My question is do I just continue to stay in broadcast or do I go become a print reporter again and get out into the field? I'll have the opportunity to cover trending news, community issues, web stories, breaking news, and investigative stories if I go with the paper. I'm just worried this experience won't count when the time comes for me to go for a field producing role.

I didn't take a lot of journalism classes in college. I want to learn how to be more boots on the ground, intrepid type of reporter. I might need more specific advice then an anonymous forum but I figured I would ask here first! thanks in advance

\- Is the best way to do this to have a source network? How do I develop sources? Who is it important to establish a relationship with and chat up? should I just  start calling people involved with various issues and seeing what's up & if they've heard anything once a month? what if it's awkward

\- sometimes I get stuck trying to think of who to call about something, especially if it's in a subject I've never covered before. what's your process for that?

\- Any advice for developing a beat? I have a couple areas I cover regularly but I'm still basically waiting til stuff develops, not actually breaking anything.

\- where to find crazy shit that people want to read? 

I feel like at least half of my stories is via stuff that comes to me (tip or press release or whatever)

context: I have to write 2 bylines a day so I'm just moving around constantly to whatever's topical - I have to go with whatever story will be sure to turn by deadline. Most of the time my stories are formulaic and have already mostly been reported by other outlets, or are low hanging fruit. I use judgement the best I can for what stories I pursue but I'm not going out there, hitting the ground/calling sources of my own ideas, I am going after what is safe and comes to me, so I don't get in trouble for not meeting  quota. I would like to write more interesting stories like when I was in school and got to come up with my own ideas. we are owned by a hedge fund

I have been in my position for long enough to have gotten as comfortable as I can with the workload, but general assignment is hard. I feel like each of my 3 editors want something more civic and a bit deeper than crime stories but it's difficult to be creative and come up with multiple original, actually good story ideas a day, or even a week. I sometimes feel like also I'm overthinking it and should just stick to car crashes to save energy for other, longer pieces I'm working on in the background - is that the strategy?

\- is it possible to do this kind of journalism with my working conditions? should I stop stressing and embrace the press releases? Any advice on time management, or how to stay afloat without burnout and working extra hours? for those in similar positions, any general advice?

474,16pj3o0,YungMangoSnaKE,2023-09-22 19:30:09+00:00,Am I just not cut out for this field?,"I'm a young journalist who has put two years into the field at two different jobs since graduating from college in 2021; one at a Gannett owned paper, and one at a small independent paper. The Gannett owned paper was chill, but it was too chill; the paper had no real editor, and it seemed as though management couldn't care less whether or not we had even 3 stories a week to publish. It was hard to get a hold of people when I needed assistance, and there was no mentorship of any sort. It was essentially a miseducation in the field of journalism. While I enjoyed the laissez-faire approach, I knew it was the worst thing for me as young journalist and that I had better go elsewhere to cultivate my talents and learn the ropes. Beyond that experience, I know that Gannett is an awful company to work for as the opportunities for advancement are few and far between, and the few reporters who had been working there for much longer than me (close to/more than a decade) hardly made more than I did just starting out.

The second paper I worked for was pretty much on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I was told it would be a place where I could develop and learn, but my editor was extremely impatient and mercurial, with very high demands of me. I dedicated 50-55 hours a week each week, worked late nights, weekends, during my vacation, and felt like I had just begun to really start getting my feet underneath me and into a steady workflow when I was fired a week after my three month eval. The reasoning she gave was that she didn't think I showed enough drive or enthusiasm, and that she didn't think she could dedicate any more time or resources into developing me, and that she didn't believe I would ever develop into the level of journalist she expected of me (5-7 stories a week, I had just started getting myself into the 3-4 story a week category.) In my defense, I think a lot of my workflow was getting stifled by her making me go back to sources to ask questions on topics that were either completely irrelevant or at best tangential to the main focus of the story, and having her hold up stories in order for me to do so (there were very, very few stories that were 5-700 words either, she expected most stories to be upwards of 1,000+).

I've had to move back in with my parents for the first time since I've embarked on my journey as a journalist and I've just worked with an old professor/mentor who has 15-20 years of experience in the field to reformat/update my application materials and I'm ready to ship applications out, but the question of whether I want to continue working in this field is making me hesitant. My mentor told me that I should disregard what this woman has said to me as hogwash, and insists that (based upon my most recent clips that he's read) that I've made admirable strides and that I'm right where I should be in my development. He said that she was clearly looking for a mid-level journalist but didn't want to pay for one, and was too impatient to take the time to continue developing me into that role. That may very well be true, but the experience itself was sobering to me.

I'd like to think that if I ever got the job of my dreams (foreign correspondent, travel writer, or perhaps just a metro reporter for a large/reputable paper) that I would be more than happy to work odd hours and late nights, but as time goes on and this field continues to go the way of the do-do, I'm starting to wonder whether I'm working towards a role that won't exist by the time I'm qualified enough to take it. I also have no idea how to even get those jobs in the first place; it's an extremely competitive fields as is (not that I need to tell any of you) and I don't have any connections in the field who have ever worked those kinds of high-profile jobs that attracted me to the field in the first place. Having been able to take a step back while unemployed, and have time for maintaining a social life or going to the gym, I'm wondering how I ever managed to transition into the state of non-stop stress and aggravation with my editor, working 10 hour days and long weeks and oftentimes not even getting breaks on weekends to decompress. I know that you have to earn your dues in this field, and after my first month at my last job I had fully embraced that, bit the bullet, stuck my nose to the grindstone, and busted my ass without complaint, just to get shit-canned in the end. What's to stop the same thing from happening at my next job?

As far as skills go, I'm a people person, I love learning about different peoples' experiences, backgrounds and cultures, I'm a huge history nerd, a strong writer (though this harebrained rant may not be indicative of that) and enjoy the idea of a job that gives me ample opportunity to leave the office during the course of work and (in a dream world) that would give me the opportunity to travel for work. I'm also a quick learner and solid researcher, I can do a damn fine job of learning the ins and outs of complicated subject matter and putting it into layman's speech. I figured all of these interests and skills would converge perfectly with journalism, but perhaps not. My weaknesses would be that I'm not as detail-oriented as I ought to be (I've made several silly, small-errors in my reporting thus far), have terrible organizational/long-term planning skills, and can be a mean procrastinator. I'm like 99% certain I have ADD and am currently working with a psychiatrist to help alleviate that.

I guess what I'm asking is how/when do you know if you're just not cut out for this field? Furthermore, what should my next steps be if I do decide to continue in it, (what kinds of news jobs sound right?) and if not, what other fields should I look to pivot to? I know PR is the obvious one, but that seems to be one journalists turn to after at least five years experience, not two. I also don't like the idea (ethically speaking) of covering corporations' asses, even if it pays well and provides way better job security/stability. Marketing? Advertising? Public Comms? I have not the first clue to get started in those fields, and I really don't want to have to go back to school either.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I really appreciate the advice and kind words. I will continue to apply myself to the field and be as selective as (reasonably) possible in terms of finding my next job. This field is uniquely hard to navigate without assistance and so I greatly appreciate everyone else‚Äôs :)",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16pj3o0/am_i_just_not_cut_out_for_this_field/,17,19,0.85,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17ccd24c0>

Writing, researching, and story-telling, has always been my passion and I would love to pursue it. I am considering doing a PHD but it's a huge long-term commitment and would involve a significant paycut.

One avenue I'm considering instead is to continue working in my Tech job, but to spend my spare time research interesting topics/news developments and writing thought pieces and analytical pieces on them. The goal would be to publish them on my own personal website portfolio or blog, while simultaneously pitching them to small time publications and websites looking for contributors.

My goal would be to have a published  thought piece or analytical article on a reputable site within 5 years time and to build on things from there, ideally one day perhaps leaving my Tech job to pursue journalism full time.

Now I'm not saying that timeline is wholly realistic or anything, but right now this is a path I am considering. I was doing this 8 years ago, but stuff happened and I moved abroad etc.... but now I'm considering this again.

I am just wondering if anyone has 'broke through' via a similar route?

Yes it will involve writing in my spare time away from work and at the weekends, but it's something I enjoy doing, so I think it will be worth it.  While at the same time I will continue to earn a salary from my Tech job that gives me a comfortable lifestyle.

I ended up needing another 90 minutes to complete the entire test. I was able to come up with three pitches and write a story on one. The job asked me why it took so long for me to complete the test.

Then, after reading ‚ÄúDemocracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America‚Äù by award-winning Duke University historian Nancy MacLean, I have tried to alert people to this threat to our republic and the clear and present danger of a Convention of the States to radically modify our Constitution. The threat is real and Texas Gov. Greg ‚ÄúMussawheelie‚Äù Abbott is part of this.

I have also urged people to be aware of the ties for the evangelical religious right by reading these books:

‚ÄúShadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right‚Äù by Anne Nelson; 

‚ÄúThe Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism‚Äù by Katherine Stewart; and,

‚ÄúJesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,‚Äù by Kristin Kobes Du Mez.

Now the American Constitution Society, the Center for Media and Democracy and Common Cause are offering a Zoom webinar to explain this threat. Please consider taking an hour of you time to attend. You can sign up here:

I took my cell phone. Didn't use it either than to take photos of nature. I drove 7 hours in a direction away from Toronto (Canada). No internet, no tweets, no instagram, no nothing else. The closest thing to technology was the mp3 player.

Went with two friends, one is of the culture next door to mine. who also has the work work work. the third one not so bad.

For two weeks, no notifications, no needing to wake up at 3 in the morning. 

Now I have no  problem with work as I love the job but just giving it the middle finger once in a while, learning to relax.

The first paragraph discusses how evangelical Christians are devoted to the abolition of abortion federally. The writer then links this concept to a vague category of ‚Äúextremist views‚Äù. I don‚Äôt care where you lie on the political spectrum, I don‚Äôt think there is any evidence to say being anti-abortion is extremist. Abortion has been a hit button issue for over 100 years. If the topic has been around that long and policies have jumped back and forth, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty mainstream topic.

The body of the article then discusses how the republican candidates endorse different pro-life policies varying from pragmatic to severe. The author also mentions Donald Trump much more than others and how he is a sexual predator based on civil litigation from a 1986 incident. While I can‚Äôt stand Trump and I would shed a tear if he got a raging case of neurosyphilis and spend the rest of his days drooling,  that info is totally irrelevant to the title of the article and as best I can tell advances no premise set forth in the article. Trumps and bad person but the author is a bad writer/journalist.

The last 2-3 paragraphs address the title topic, but beyond rehashing the poll saying most Americans oppose abortion does nothing to actually discuss whether the Republican Party needs evangelicals. 

I just did a quick google search. Turns out evangelical identify as republican 56% of the time second only to Mormons. 

https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/

Turns out 25% of Americans identify as evangelical (6-35% estimated range says Wikipedia)

https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/05/12/chapter-1-the-changing-religious-composition-of-the-u-s/#:~:text=Today%2C%2025%25%20of%20U.S.%20adults,one%20percentage%20point%20since%202007.

I just google this over 2 minutes and have data that says republicans should alienate evangelicals at their own peril. 

I can‚Äôt believe the author is an editor. This is awful writing even for an opinion piece. It drips with bias. Makes not attempt to present facts in  a structured manner and doesn‚Äôt even address the by line until the end and sh!ts the bed horribly when it does.

555,16ipxrv,ruefool,2023-09-14 18:27:47+00:00,Seeking advice on leveling up as a journalist,"Hi all,   


I write for a news website covering the stock market market, crypto, and other finance-related news. While my current job position is okay, I don't see myself working for this site for an extensive period as much of the content is clickbait crap and recycled content with catchy headlines.   


Anyway, I've been doing this type of news/articles for a couple of years now as a freelance writer, and I feel it is time to up my game. With that being said, there are several questions I'd like to ask you fellow writers and journalists that could help me.  


1) I am a non-native English speaker. So far I did not get any complaints about my English writing skills from my employers, but I do feel there's much room for improvement. For instance, when I'm reading articles in top publications like NYT, Washington Post, and Bloomberg, there's a clear difference in writing compared to mine.   


How do I achieve this level? Should I read a lot of articles on a daily basis, or read more books (not a habit I currently have), or are there any specific 'techniques' to learn that could help me become a top-notch writer?  


2) I asked the first question because my aim is to eventually become good enough to apply for positions at top websites. Having said that, how does one get there?   


3) What are your day-to-day habits that you've noticed really helped you get better at writing/journalism? Also, open to any great book/course recommendations.   


4) Is there any advice you'd give me for the long run? For instance, I was thinking of eventually launching my own news website in the future but I'm not sure how difficult it is to actually monetize this given that the competition is insane.   


I'd also be open to transitioning to other, non-finance areas. For example, I'm very invested in soccer (it's football!) but I think making that shift would be quite difficult. 

I hope the post is not too long. Looking forward to all pieces of advice and tips! ",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16ipxrv/seeking_advice_on_leveling_up_as_a_journalist/,4,5,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17cf06df0>

I had a little freelance writing experience before (no amazing publications and virtually no reported work), but I went to j-school because I thought if I only worked hard enough and attended as prestigious an institution as Columbia Journalism School, I would succeed in getting national publications.

Turns out that I overestimated my own journalistic abilities, and I was a lot farther away from success than I realized. When I realized that my writing wasn't anything special compared to my peers and grinding only got me one published clip (at the local level), I slowly began to lose interest. 

At the end of my program, I was just barely doing the minimum I needed to get passing grades under our pass-fail system. I just felt deflated because working hard wasn't getting me anywhere, and I felt overmatched given the demands of my teachers and the accomplishments of my peers.

Also, I realized that I don't have much interest in reporting; I just like to write narratives as a hobby. The whole process of finding sources, interviewing them, transcribing interviews, and then publishing just holds little meaning to me compared to my former career. 

Even the one clip I got did little more than get me a couple of disgruntled emails from readers. My frustration was compounded when I saw classmates of mine get published in national outlets and win awards, and all I had to show for my time in j-school was a pile of debt.

I spent the summer taking time off and visiting family. Now that I have some distance from my j-school experience, is it bad to go on with my life as if I never studied journalism? Am I giving up too early? Should I at least give freelancing another go? Did anybody else feel the same way after j-school as I do? My classmates put on this face of being so enthusiastic about the industry, so I feel kind of alone and scared to admit how I feel to friends.

I, like a lot of my former shipmates, joined for relatively selfish reasons: job security, health insurance, tuition assistance and the chance to travel the world. But
 I often find it hard to take pride in my military service as a black queer person with a bit of an ‚Äúidealist‚Äù personal philosophy. ‚ÄúWhy take pride in a country that can‚Äôt take pride in you?‚Äù As my step dad used to say. 

 I used my GI bill to put myself through art school, though I still owe way too much money and haven‚Äôt found as much fulfillment in the work as I had prior to school. Like, my art looks better than ever, but I‚Äôm so burned out that drawing feels more like a chore to feed an algorithm than a passion anymore. It‚Äôs a weird feeling because I‚Äôve wanted to make comics my entire life. I‚Äôm kinda having a bit of an identity crisis because of it. 

I try to stay up to date on current events though I sometimes take breaks if it starts effecting my mental health. I didn‚Äôt get the best grades in high school, but I do actually like learning new things. It‚Äôs just that because of my adhd, my performance tends to be interest based. If I get bored of a project, I LITERALLY CANNOT force myself to complete it. I tend to do my best work under a tight deadline, which I‚Äôve heard echoed in other adhd experiences. 
My day job isn‚Äôt super fulfilling or challenging, and though money is an important factor, I‚Äôve never had much interest in making more than I‚Äôd need to survive comfortably as a single New Yorker. (Which is a lot more expensive than I‚Äôd expected üò≠) 

All I really want is to be able look back and say I made the world a little better, or at least that I didn‚Äôt make it any worse. 


TLDR; I found a few articles about careers that are best suited to those with really bad adhd,
 and Journalism came up as a potential path. I‚Äôve always loved writing essays and discussing complex issues, I‚Äôm never afraid of being corrected by those with more knowledge or insight, and I especially love the leg work that comes with researching new topics. And I know comics journalism could provide an interesting intersection between my educational background and this. I think if I really put my mind to it, I could be good at it. 

But I worry about sinking even more money and energy toward a journalism degree when I see the industry becoming increasingly privatized and print continuing to disappear. And I don‚Äôt know how much interest I have in internet freelance. So Is it too late for me to become a journalist? Would anyone hire me without a degree? What would I need to get started? Is the pay even livable?

It touched on a current political topic and I was commissioned for 1000 words (at this magazine that is the maximum word count mainly for budget/invoice reasons but your actual word count can go to 1300ish).

As I was writing it become clear that it wouldn‚Äôt be under 1000. The topic is way too nuanced.

What I turned in was 2000 and I was fully aware that it would be cut down. I was mostly okay with the edits (the editor did her best) but the legal/political point was clearly not a topic that was familiar to the editor and therefore there was a tiny but significant misunderstanding. I reached back out to point it out. And I‚Äôm sure it will be easily sorted.

But I just think it‚Äôs sad that this is the state of journalism / media. Because there‚Äôs nothing really stopping them from allowing 1500 features. I‚Äôm sure whoever wants to read the article wouldn‚Äôt mind reading an extra 200-300 words that make much more in-depth points. 

This also happened to me with another publication only the topic was much more culturally sensitive and the editor seemed to be extremely defensive, taking everything personally, and trying to twist my words to fit her personal POV instead of the average reader. I had to withdraw the story because it would have been damaging to the people involved. It was drafted at 1500 for the digital site, but it needed to be 1000. Again I was aware that it was over the limit but this editor was much more strict. I‚Äôve since not been able to find anywhere to take the story and it‚Äôs a bit disappointing because it‚Äôs actually an interesting topic that I haven‚Äôt seen covered in any of those mags. 


I‚Äôve decided to quit writing because on this side of media they only seem to be interested in commercial themes and listicles (affiliate links).

I get interviewed, get told I‚Äôm great and answer well, get told I‚Äôm very likeable, then they tell me they‚Äôre giving the job to someone with more experience in the field.

What I can‚Äôt understand is how so many journalists I know have just jumped right into PR roles with no extra training in PR while for me it seems an issue.

582,16gypmq,BostonsBest33,2023-09-12 18:17:38+00:00,Where are you looking for journalism jobs?,"Just a little bit of context. 

I recently graduated in May with a double major in sports journalism and graphic design. I had three internships in college and wrote for my university‚Äôs newspaper. But finding a job has been more difficult than I had anticipated, I understand that this is a competitive field but the amount of companies I‚Äôve applied to with no response back from them is astonishing. Maybe I‚Äôm just not looking in the right spots? Currently my search is primarily conducted on LinkedIn, Google jobs, indeed and teamwork online. I‚Äôve made it clear to potential employers that I‚Äôm willing to relocate, and I always write a cover letter that is unique to the job and company that I‚Äôm applying for. Mostly what I‚Äôve seen are small time newspapers that never reach back out to me, or internships with major league teams who also never reach back out to me. I currently have a freelance gig with an online publication but the salary is based on total revenue and it‚Äôs a small publication so I don‚Äôt really get paid anything. 

So if anyone has websites they would recommend for finding sports journalism jobs or any advice when it comes to applying to jobs in the journalism field then feel free to leave it in the comments or dm me.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16gypmq/where_are_you_looking_for_journalism_jobs/,13,7,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17cfda490>

588,16gytol,NewClayburn,2023-09-12 18:21:54+00:00,Does this make sense for a sponsorship package?,"I live in a rural area where we don't have much access to local news.  The paper in my hometown cut back to one issue per week and only has a couple local stories in it.  A nearby town publishes more regularly, but the bigger issue is that nobody reads papers anymore anyway.  By the time an article comes out in the paper, people have already spread rumors and misinformation about the news on Facebook.

So I set up an online news website to try to fill some gaps.  We've done a good job so far of getting some regular articles out, but there is still a lot we don't get around to covering.  I haven't tried monetizing it yet, but want to do that now that we've established ourselves so that we can cover our costs but also to hopefully expand.

So I've put together a sponsorship package.  You can see the details here if you're interested:   
https://www.leacountytribune.com/sponsor/

Essentially it's $1,350/year.  Businesses would be listed as sponsors on our website, get a featured article written up about them and their business and we'll put some ads for them into our ad rotations on the site.  Plus we're planning to host an annual banquet, so sponsors will get two free tickets to attend that.

This is a small area, so I'm worried about the price point and delivering value for the businesses.  However I'm hoping they'll be happy to support something that's good for the community.

(We also have a Patreon where regular people can donate too, but I want to focus on getting some sponsorships to cover costs.)

I appreciate any feedback or advice you have on this.  I know it's difficult to fund journalism these days.",Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/16gytol/does_this_make_sense_for_a_sponsorship_package/,6,2,1.0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17cfe8b20>
